# deswissknife
This is a set of tools to make data engineer's life easy. It's the swiss knife for data engineer.

Doing data munging is not difficult but takes time and need quite a lot of 'preparation' before the actual data processing.
You have to store raw data in a file or somewhere accessible;
You have to decide there to store the processed data;
You have to do a bunch of manual copy and paste -- simple but boring;
You may have to manually compare source and target to find the difference by your eye......

With the 'swiss knife' standing by at the backend or using it directly, you can quickly convert your data. Though it may only save a few minutes,
it makes the boring manual work insteresting and efficient. And a few minutes every time could be a lot of time for the long run...
